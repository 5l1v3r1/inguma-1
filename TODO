Long list of things to do, classified by difficulty:

Easy:
- Unify access to users/passwords dictionaries.  Right now there's an unused
  function loadUserPasswords() in lib/ui/core.py and several manual loads
  (like modules/brute/sybase/CBrute.py).
- Add additional logging facilities (a centralized one) in the output manager.
- Replace every single print in the code by calls (echo or debug) to the
  appropriate OM.

Medium:
- Get rid of pygtk-isms scattered across the codebase.
