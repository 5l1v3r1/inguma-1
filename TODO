Long list of things to do, classified by difficulty:

Easy:
- Unify access to users/passwords dictionaries.  Right now there's an unused
  function loadUserPasswords() in lib/ui/core.py and several manual loads
  (like modules/brute/sybase/CBrute.py).
- Add additional logging facilities (a centralized one) in the output manager.
- Replace every single print in the code by calls (echo or debug) to the
  appropriate OM.
- Stop using 'dir1' + os.sep + 'dir2' + ... and move to os.path.join() at the
  very least.  We are using a mix of the above plus UNIX paths across the
  codebase.  See lib/ui/node_menu.py for an example.

Medium:
- Get rid of pygtk-isms scattered across the codebase.
